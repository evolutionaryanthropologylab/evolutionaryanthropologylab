<h2>Graduations!</h2>
<p>Ariane Thomas successfully defended her dissertation in April 2024. Ariane moved to Maryland in May for a postdoc position at the National Institutes of Health. She will investigate the genetic architecture that controls for body size variation in modern dog populations. She is currently collaborating with Pamunkey and Chickahominy Indian Tribes and the Pawnee Nation to study their relationships with their dogs.</p>
<p>Mack Cross, Dani Johnson and Tristan Szymanski received their MAs this year!</p>

<h2>Communicating Evolution to the Public</h2>
<p>Two of our undergrads, Gabriella Snyder and Seren Castellano, were selected as Latham Scholars, an initiative designed to train undergrads in science communication methods. They each completed projects in 2024 to engage the public on topics related to evolution.  
</p>
<p>Gabriella designed a science communication game. She describes her project: "Biological evolution, particularly human evolution, continues to be a misconstrued topic in the public psyche. These erroneous beliefs often take root in adolescence. My project, rEVOLUTIONary: the competition towards humanity, aims to counteract these beliefs and foster evolution's scientific veracity. To do so, I created an interactive and immersive board game about human evolution for middle schoolers. I hosted game nights for this project, where players encountered unexpected outcomes and challenged their opponents as they battled to evolve to a human the fastest."
